**Prep Time:** PT20M | **Cook Time:** PT20M | **Total Time:** PT40M | **Servings:** 6

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. ground beef
- 1 lb. ground pork
- ½ cup panko bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons white sesame seeds (+ more for topping)
- 3 green onions (minced (+ more for topping))
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons chili garlic sauce
- 1 large egg
- 3 cups chopped broccoli
- 3 bok choy (chopped)
- ½ medium red onion (chopped)
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- ¼ cup chili garlic sauce
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF and grease a baking sheet with avocado oil.
2. Add all of the ingredients for the meatballs into a large bowl and mix the ingredients together until combined.
3. Using a tablespoon scoop, scoop three tablespoons into your hand and roll the meat into a ball. Place on the greased baking sheet. Repeat until all of the meat mixture has been made into balls. It helps to wet your hands so the meat doesn't stick to them.
4. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 minutes, flipping halfway.
5. While the meatballs are baking, add the broccoli, bok choy, and red onion to a second baking sheet. Coat the vegetables with soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar. Toss to coat the vegetables. Add the vegetables to the oven and bake for 10 minutes or until they reach the desired doneness.
6. While the meatballs and vegetables are baking, add all of the ingredients for the sauce to a bowl and whisk to combine.
7. Remove the meatballs from the oven when the internal temperature of the meatballs reaches 165ºF, 20-20 minutes.
8. Serve the meatballs and vegetables over jasmine rice and top with the honey garlic chili sauce and white sesame seeds. Enjoy.
